# A simple Copilot demo

A demo to use Azure Cognitive Search and Azure OpenAI to create a copilot for your business data.

You can look at my presentation on how to build a company data driven chatbot [here](https://github.com/e11en/Api.CopilotDemo/blob/main/docs/Presentation-Building-a-company-data-driven-chatbot.pdf).

Within our demo setup, this code is for our API to connect it all together.
